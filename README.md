# AI Painting Generator

## Overview

This project is an AI painting generator that allows users to create unique and original paintings using OpenAI's DALL-E 2 and DALL-E 3 models. Users can input a short description of the painting they want to create, select a painting theme, and adjust image parameters such as size. The app then generates a prompt based on the input, which users can use to create their painting.
